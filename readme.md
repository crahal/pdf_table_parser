This is an extension of [pdfminer3k](https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer3k/), joint work with [ianknowles](https://github.com/ianknowles/pdftableparser) that extracts tabular data (with a focus on institutional accounts) from pdf files published under David Cameron's [2010 transparency push](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130104174825/http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/letter-to-government-departments-on-opening-up-data/).

Requires pdfminer3k and Pillow packages as detailed in the requirements.txt file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)Â·

Outputs .csv files in the same directory as the input (.pdf) file. There might be the odd edge case; feel free to fork, unit test, and raise issues!

Funded by the British Academy as part of the [NHSSpend](https://github.com/crahal/NHSSpend) project.
